# cdss-lib-dmi-satmonsys-java #

This repository contains
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss)
Java library for
the State of Colorado's Satellite Monitoring System database.
**This library will be phased out because new web services provide equivalent functionality.**

Eclipse is used for development and repositories currently contain Eclipse project files to facilitate
setting up the Eclipse development environment.
Development on library code usually occurs while developing an application such as TSTool,
rather than the library alone, because software requirements come from application development.

See the following online resources:

* [Colorado's Decision Support Systems](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss)
* [OpenCDSS](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss-website-opencdss/) - currently
hosted on the Open Water Foundation website while the OpenCDSS server is being configured
* [TSTool Developer Documentation](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss-app-tstool-doc-dev/) - example of application that uses this library

## Repository Dependencies ##

Repository dependencies fall into two categories as indicated below.

### Repository Dependencies for this Repository ###

This library depends on other repositories listed in the following table.
The repository contains Eclipse configuration files that describe the dependencies so that
this repository and others can be cloned when setting up a development environment,
with minimal additional configuration (for example see TSTool Developer documentation).

|**Repository**|**Description**|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|[`cdss-lib-common-java`](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-lib-common-java)   |Library of core utility code used by multiple repos.|
|[`cdss-lib-dmi-hydrobase-java`](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-lib-dmi-hydrobase-java)   |Library for Colorado HydroBase database.|

### Repositories that Depend on this Repository ###

The following repositories are known to depend on this repository:

|**Repository**|**Description**|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|[`cdss-app-tstool-main`](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-tstool-main)                           |Main TSTool application code.|
|[`cdss-lib-processor-ts-java`](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-lib-processor-ts-java)               |Library of processing code used by TSTool.|

## Development Environment Folder Structure ##

The following folder structure is recommended for software development.
Top-level folders should be created as necessary.
Repositories are expected to be on the same folder level to allow cross-referencing
scripts in those repositories to work.
TSTool is used as an example, and normally use of this repository will occur
through development of the main CDSS applications.
See the application's developer documentation for more information.

```
C:\Users\user\                               Windows user home folder (typical development environment).
/home/user/                                  Linux user home folder (not tested).
/cygdrive/C/Users/user                       Cygdrive home folder (not tested).
  cdss-dev/                                  Projects that are part of Colorado's Decision Support Systems.
    TSTool/                                  TSTool product folder (will be similar for other applications).
      eclipse-workspace/                     Folder for Eclipse workspace, which references Git repository folders.
                                             The workspace folder is not maintained in Git.
      git-repos/                             Git repositories for TSTool.
        cdss-lib-dmi-satmonsys-java/         This repository.
        ...others...                         See application developer documenation and README for full list.

```

## Version ##

A version for the library is typically not defined.
Instead, tags are used to cross-reference the library version with commit of application code such as TSTool.
This allows checking out a version of the library consistent with an application version.
This approach might need to change if the library is seen as an independent resource that is used by many third-party applications.

## Contributing ##

Contributions to this project can be submitted using the following options:

1. Software developers with commit privileges can write to this repository
as per normal OpenCDSS development protocols.
2. Post an issue on GitHub with suggested change.  Provide information using the issue template.
3. Fork the repository, make changes, and do a pull request.
Contents of the current master branch should be merged with the fork to minimize
code review before committing the pull request.

See also the [OpenCDSS / protocols](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss-website-opencdss/) for each software application.
